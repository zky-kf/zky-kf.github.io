Sharing some of my life experience and thoughts. Might be insightful, or helpful if it resonates with you.

<br>
I'll start with the difficulties I've went through.
* I came from a high school in which the people who studied computer science constitutes a very small population (<10). Upon graduating high school and entering college, I met my classmate's brother who studies CS and has related internships. I was excited to hear more about CS opportunities in college and beyond, but it turned out that he was very interested and took actions in which at that time I was uncomfortable and didn't know how to respond properly because I have never dated anyone before. The initial exposure to women interested in tech lead me to forgo CS as my major entering college, and I switched back into CS late regretting the opportunities I've missed.
* When I finally switched back into CS during my undergraduate years, I had trouble fitting - and fitting in with peers is an essential part for a successful college experience. I went to Rice University, which has a high population of upper middle class or international students (aka pretty rich). I wanted to join good study groups. But a lot of my fellow classmates were very trendy and fashionable, drink & party, like to eat out a lot and travel to distant places. I found that most people who I can relate to socioeconomically and culturally (in terms of money spending patterns) were struggling to do well in CS. The observation fell in line with the statistical correlation of people who do well in top colleges and people who come from a rich family. And falling into the other category, I experienced struggles that I feel like would not have happened if I attended a larger public university where I can find my suitable, supportive peer group.

Here's how I've learnt to deal with it over the years.
* Gain the knowledge necessary to fare well as women in CS. This includes stepping beyond the comfort zones from a possible conservative upbringing, and diversify your circle of peers. Make many different friends. So you don't have to feel like being in a situation in which you desperately need to befriend someone who can provide you information on future opportunities etc.
* Shift between different identities and learn how to navigate level. Just an example, this is what works for me: if casually engaging in small-talks or going to eat or take a small drink is how people around me make friends and connections, I might give this a try too. This is what I learnt over a summer having by chance lived/became acquainted with fellow interns from top billionaire families.
* Be confident! Confidence is the key ingredient for career women. For the same level of knowledge, you will come out more successful if you project what you know more confidently and speak up to ask meaningful questions.

General thoughts? Work hard. Play hard. Don't be afraid, and live life to the fullest!
