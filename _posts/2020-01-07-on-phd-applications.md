When you are applying for a CS PhD, you can be taking an important step in your life. Here are some tips on applying so that you can place your best foot forward. 

<br>
I have had an unsuccessful round of PhD applications, but 1-2 years later, I finally landed myself into UIUC and a top-choice lab. Comparing my experience, these are what I've done differently and what I think helped.
* **Start your Statement of Purpose early.** In my initial (failed) attempt applying to PhD, I was told that my personal statement sucked. This time, I finished brainstorming my statement of purpose in September and writing it in October. While writing, I went through many rounds of edits - with myself, my boyfriend, the Campus Library Writing Center, and the CS Writing Faculty. I worked on my statement of purpose almost every day, for 2-6 hrs. Each day can shed a new light on how to frame the paper better. And finally, November is the time to tweak that final paragraph towards the different schools I'm applying too and start submitting. The effort put into the statement of purpose really paid off. 
* **Position your Statement of Purpose wisely.** The statement of purpose is all about your research potential. This means there's no need to get too personal with it. For example, I cut down the personal side of why I'm interested in CS and PhD to one or two sentences at the introduction that transitioned smoothly into research interests next. As for the core part of the paper, I touched upon an early research experience, a main research experience that I'm very proud of, the research accomplishments and revelations achieved, as well as intended future research direction. Remember to use word choices that demonstrate your ability to think, make decisions, research, and communicate. **Start early and revise! :)** Finally, keep sentences short, <2 lines, so that people can have an easy time reading through it instead of dumping it into the trash pile. The same goes for paragraphs - keep each under ~234 words to not bore readers. 
* **Apply to many PhD programs.** Unless you have a first-author top conference or journal paper in sight, there's really no guarantees on whether you'll get admitted. **Applying to 10-20 schools is a very realistic game plan.** Even with very strong recommendations, my luckier friend only has a ~25% acceptance rate, and I have a 10% acceptance rate on my PhD application record. Well, we all applied to target schools or reach schools. But basically, it boils down to: apply to 20 top programs, get into 2-5 of them, and be happy.
* **Make sure your recommendation writers submit on time** This is super important. I've been getting emails from multiple places e.g. Stanford warning me that they have already started reviewing the applications and will not look at my application because my final letter of recommendation is not in yet. Ask your recommender in August if you're confident, or October by the latest. Provide them with the list of schools you're applying to, your CV, and your statement of purpose in progress. Remind them to write it 2 weeks before the application is due, and ask them repeatedly every single day if they haven't submitted 2 days before the letter deadline. I even went up to their PhD students to ask the professor to finish my letter.
* **Submit your application early.** I personally think it's good idea to submit the application a little early, like 1 week in advance, for top schools like MIT/Stanford/CMU. There has been some insider information leaks that these schools deal with a TON of applications, which means that after they go through the application pool and found a number of good potential candidates to thoroughly review/interview, there is not as much bandwidth for the applicants down the pool who has submitted later. Regardless of what the administrators officially say, be on the safe end is a better bet.
* **Looking back, what could I have done differently?** I was maxed out on energy and time at the end of the fall application season, but emailing professors to express interest and knowledge in their research area is a good idea if you have the bandwidth. Not that they will reply back to you for sure, but this can *slightly* increase your admission chances - especially if you lie along the fence of being interviewed by a professor or not. Otherwise, professors who find your application interesting will also reach out to you directly. It's case-by-case.
* **Lastly, don't give up if things don't pan out.** You can always keep your options open, look into applied research scientist positions, and apply again next year. Good luck!
